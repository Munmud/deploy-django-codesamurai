suggest a schedule
-------------------
1. Scheduled time for waste collection from a specific neighborhood. Collecting earlier has no benefit, but a late collection should be penalized.
2. Multiple neighborhoods can be chained together for collecting waste and depositing it to the STS instead of going back and forth for each neighborhood.
3. Emphasis should be put on bringing the required amount of waste to the designated STS within the collection hours of the STS.

Bill generation
----------------
• Wc: Weight of waste collected by the contractor in tons.
• Wr: Required waste the contractor must collect in tons.
• Pt: Payment per tonnage of waste in taka.
• F: Fine rate for each ton of waste not collected as required.

Basic Pay = Wc × Pt
Deficit = max(0, Wr − Wc)
Fine = Deficit × F
Total Bill = Basic Pay − Fine
